### PROBLEM STATEMENT
According to the New York State Gaming Commission, daily fantasy sports players
paid more than $3.2 billion in contest entry fees during the 2017-2018 fiscal
year. One of the most quantifiable professional sports leagues is Major League
Baseball, which has statistics available at a level of granularity unmatched by
other sports. For my capstone project I will create a database of player stats
and use regression modeling on that data to predict the daily performance of
batters and starting pitchers. Then I will use those predictions to generate
the best possible daily lineup of players within the constraints of the
DraftKings roster rules.
