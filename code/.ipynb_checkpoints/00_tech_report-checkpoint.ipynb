    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Since 2001, Major League Baseball has hosted the \"Beat the Streak\" competition. Every day of the regular season, participants can choose a player who they think will record a hit in that day's game. If a participant builds up a virtual \"hitting streak\" of 57 games to beat Joe DiMaggio's record 56-game hitting streak, he or she will receive a grand prize of $5.6 million dollars. With the competition currently in its nineteenth year, no one has ever won the prize.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to increase the likelihood of success in \"Beat the Streak,\" I will use predictive analytics on batter performance data from three years worth of individual regular season games to create a binary classification model. This model will try to determine the safest player selections on a given day to extend a streak."

    "## Data Collection\n",
    "For this project, I collected batting data for the 2015-2018 regular seasons from [FanGraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com \"FanGraphs\"), along with batting data for the beginning of the 2019 season (through May 12) . Each row of data represents a single batter's stats for a single game. I downloaded the data in a series of csv files, but because of the way the data is structured I needed to reassemble each season into a single pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "FanGraphs categorizes the data into separate files for standard batting stats, advanced batting stats, and batted ball stats. A complete season of data consists of six files for each of these three different stat groups for a total of 18 csv files per season. I created a function to speed up the process of stitching together the 18 files into a single DataFrame for each season. The function takes in a base filepath that specifies the season and stat group, and it takes in the number of files in that series. It then concatenates all the files for each stat group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the four comprehensive DataFrames were compiled, one per season, I moved on to EDA, cleaning, and pre-processing."

    "## EDA\n",
    "The first step of my EDA and cleaning was to gauge the frequency of player appearances in each of the three seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "![full_player_freq](../techreport_images/full_player_freq.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "I didn't like what I saw in that distribution. The data was dominated by observations of players who each individually made very few appearances in the season. If a player played that infrequently, I couldn't assume that his skills were in line with those of an everyday player. He may also be a pitcher, particularly in the American League where his batting opportunities would be limited to interleague away games. In any event, the performance of these infrequent batters are unlikely to be useful for predicting the performance of more offensive-focused players, and even the best bench players represent a much riskier proposition as Beat the Streak picks, so being able to predict their performance is not a priority for this project. For these reasons, I dropped all observations for players who appear in less than one quarter of the season's games, leaving me with the following distribution:\n",

    "## Moving Forward\n",
    "The project as it stands is a reasonable first step but I can greatly improve the hit predictor in future iterations. Moving into Phase Two, I believe the biggest and most needed improvement is to **add opposing pitcher data** into the model's features. The myriad factors both in and out of each individual game that determine bullpen use will limit my ability to effectively include relief pitcher stats, but introducing relevant stats for each game's opposing starting pitcher is a reasonable next step. Introducing categorical **venue and weather statistics** for each game is the other main priority for Phase Two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase Three of the hit predictor will be more advanced as it involves adding a clustering component. By analyzing data on players' physical attributes, situational player performance, and style of play, I can **create player types for both batters and starting pitchers**. By introducing these profiles to the model, I can account for how certain types of batters fare against certain types of pitchers and incorporate that interaction into the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the next steps of improving the hit predictor, if the process shows potential for broader performance prediction, these investigations could serve as the foundation of a **daily fantasy baseball lineup generator** for use on websites like DraftKings or FanDuel."
